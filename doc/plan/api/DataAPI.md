### Data API

## Konur Nordberg

## Overview:

The API design focuses on simplicity, extensibility, and robustness:

* Simplicity: The API should be straightforward to understand and use, providing clear
  abstractions for common tasks.
* Extensibility: It must support easy extension and customization without the need to alter
  the existing codebase.
* Robustness: The API should handle edge cases and errors gracefully, providing clear
  feedback to the developer.

By following the SOLID principles, we can ensure that the API is well-structured and that each
class has a single, clear purpose. The goal is for developers to think about game design in terms
of object interactions and behaviors, rather than specific implementations. This approach allows for
a flexible system that can be easily extended with new functionality.

## Classes:

```java
package com.gameframework.factories;

import java.util.function.BiConsumer;

/**
 * The Factory interface represents a contract for creating instances of a particular type.
 * @param <T> the type of object created by the factory
 */
public interface Factory<T> {

  /**
   * Creates an instance of T using the provided arguments.
   * @param args the arguments used for instance creation
   * @return an instance of T
   */
  T create(Object... args);
}
```

```java
package com.gameframework.factories;

/**
 * ReflectiveFactory uses reflection to create instances of classes dynamically.
 * @param <T> the type of object that this factory creates
 */
public class ReflectiveFactory<T> implements Factory<T> {

  private final Class<T> typeToken;

  public ReflectiveFactory(Class<T> typeToken) {
    this.typeToken = typeToken;
  }

  /**
   * Creates an instance of T using the provided arguments.
   * @param args the constructor arguments
   * @return an instance of T
   */
  @Override
  public T create(Object... args) {
    // Implementation of reflection-based object creation
  }
}
```

```java
package com.gameframework.behaviors;

/**
 * CollisionBehaviorFactory is responsible for creating lambdas that define collision behaviors.
 */
public class CollisionBehaviorFactory {

  /**
   * Creates a lambda function that defines the behavior for a collision event.
   * @param <T> the type of collidable objects
   * @return a lambda function representing the collision behavior
   */
  public static <T> BiConsumer<T, T> createCollisionBehavior() {
    // Implementation for collision behavior creation
  }
}
```

## Details

* Factories: Factory<T> provides a generic interface for creating objects. ReflectiveFactory<T>
  is an implementation that uses reflection, allowing for dynamic object creation at runtime.

* Behaviors: CollisionBehaviorFactory provides a method for creating lambdas that define behaviors
  for collision events between objects. This allows game developers to specify how objects interact
  when they collide without writing boilerplate code.

## Considerations:

* Performance and Reflection: Reflection can introduce performance overhead. Careful consideration
  and benchmarking are required to ensure that the factory's use of reflection does not negatively
  impact the game's performance.
* Type Safety: The factory API should include measures to ensure type safety wherever possible,
  to prevent runtime errors.
* Error Handling: The API should provide comprehensive error handling to give developers clear
  information if object creation fails.
* Documentation: Each class and method will be documented using Javadoc to ensure clarity and
  ease of use.
