# OOGASalad Stand Up and Retrospective Discussion

### TEAM 01

## Stand Up Meeting

### Noah

* Work done this Sprint
  This week I spent a great deal of time working on refactoring the GameEngine and adapting it to allow for the creation of new games. I developed both shuffleboarding and pinball, wrote the necessary commands for it, as well as wrote integration tests for them. I also spent time documenting and writing unit tests for the game engine. Additionally, I improved the design of the game engine by adding an adaptor pattern with the concepts of scoreables, controllables, and strikeables.

* Plan for next Sprint?

I hope to have time to start working on the backend aspects of the database and both extension requirements, as well as live games such as soccer and air hockey. This will require some interaction with the GameController as well. Furthermore, it will require the use of a socket to allow players to use multiple devices. The GameEngine is mostly done, but I will likely need to make slight changes based upon what the authooring enviornment is able to do. 

* Blockers/Issues in your way

One major blocker that I am facing is the unfinished authoring enviornment, as it makes it take significantly more time to make test json files for integration tests. A lot of it needs to be hardcoded for now, and the hardcoding needs to change when certain changes are made to the backend, which complicates things. The best thing I can do is to be patient and offer to help with the authoring environment when needed.

### Doga

* Work done this Sprint
  * Worked on planning/helping with the refactoring of the authoring environment. Specifically, the splitting of the
  AuthoringScreen to different functionality and UI component based classes.

* Plan for next Sprint?
  * Continue refactoring; implement transition and pause screens; make more view tests; improve the look of the game (visuals/graphicsg)

* Blockers/Issues in your way
  * The refactoring is very extensive and time-consuming. In addition, I can't begin writing more view authoring environment tests until the refactoring is finished.

## Project's current progress

Authoring Enviornment design being significantly improved every day. The game engine is nearly done. The extensions are not being worked on, so that needs to start ASAP. It is tricky because this is a week where everyone has midterms, but we are still chugging along and making a ton of process. We are also working towards making the front end and authoring enviornment a lot more configurable, to remove hardcoding whenever possible.

## Current level of communication

The communication has been great. We are using our group chat frequently and meeting almost nightly to work together, have a stand up meeting, and go over necessary tasks. This has been extremely useful in making sure everyone is on task and has something to work on. We can probably do a better job of explaining what we are currently working on at all times and how it relates to our goals for each sprint.

## Satisfaction with team roles

I think we are mostly satisfied with team roles. Every few days they are definitely shifting as people have midterms, but we are all trying to share the burden of the work. I think we need to put a larger emphasis on the higher priority things in the backlog. I think there are some refactorings / features that ought to be emphasized more for the sake of demos / getting a working project.

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1: We should continue to have daily stand-ups and work together every night using peer programming, and also just bouncing ideas off of each other
* Thing #2: We should continue to articulate our availability, plans, and expectations for the week so that everyone is on the same page with respect to deadlines.

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1: We should try to do a better job of communicating what branches we are currently updating, and what features we are working on, to avoid merge conflicts.

* Thing #2: We should try to do a better job of practicing demos and presentations as a whole team, and make it clear who is going to present what, and what exactly they should focus on

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

Next sprint, I think we should put a larger emphasis on the backlog and adding weights to certain tasks. We are approaching crunchtime, and we ought to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make the best-designed, feature-packed project by the deadline. Focusing on less-important / less-critical design choices will only be a time-suck and not help us achieve this goal.
