# OOGASalad Stand Up and Retrospective Discussion

### TEAM 01

## Stand Up Meeting

### Noah

* Work done this Sprint
  This week I spent a great deal of time working on refactoring the GameEngine. I added new
  abstractions such as the Condition and StaticStateHandler, which utilize the command pattern and
  chain of responsibility pattern. Additionally, I began the process of abstracting away and
  refactoring the physics engine.

* Plan for next Sprint?

Next sprint, I plan on wearing “many hats”. I hope to have time to start working on the backend
aspects of the database, but my main priority will be making sure the game engine is flexible enough
to handle new games such as pinball and shuffle boarding. This will involve doing more robust
testing of the turn policy and scoring related commands, as well as communicating with the front end
to provide more of a concrete implementation of the concept of control labels.

* Blockers/Issues in your way

One of the key blockers for the team I think is the infrequency of integration. We should be merging
to main more often and going on a feature by feature basis, to ensure that we are all on the same
page. For me personally, I am struggling with a bug pertaining to scoring, as the command is not
being applied correctly. However, it is passing my tests, so I should probably write more.
